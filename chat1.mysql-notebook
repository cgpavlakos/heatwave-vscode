Implementing these requirements on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) can be a complex process, but with the right guidance, it can be done effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn this white paper, we will provide an overview of the key considerations when implementing M-21-31 EL1 on OCI. We will discuss the various features and capabilities of OCI that can help meet these requirements, such as fault tolerance, data backup, security, monitoring and alarming, and more.\n\nWe will also provide a reference architecture that shows how OCI services can be deployed and configured to meet the subset of the universal and PEP security capabilities relevant to the establishment of a secure landing zone for deployment of workloads into OCI. This reference architecture is intended to help US Federal customers understand how to implement M-21-31 EL1 on OCI in a way that meets their specific needs and requirements.\n\nOverall, this white paper aims to provide practical guidance and best practices for implementing M-21-31 EL1 on OCI, helping US Federal customers ensure the security and integrity of their data while taking advantage of the many benefits that OCI has to offer.",
